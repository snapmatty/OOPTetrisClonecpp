# OOPTetrisClonecpp
OOP project of a tetris game made in CMD.



HELLO!

Welcome to my first OOP project!
This is a tetris-like game where the goal is to get as many points as possible before the game is over.
I have included a pdf file describing each class and method in more detail as well as left some comments in my code so that it is
easy to understand.

The project itself took me around 1.5 weeks to complete. 

HOW TO PLAY:

-use left arrow, right arrow and down arrow to move the tetromino piece 

-using the "X" and "S" key you rotate the piece counter clockwise and clockwise 

-pressing "B" causes the game to pause, after that pressing any keys will resume the game to its previous state

After the game is completed the player's score is saved to an external file. 

Enjoy.
